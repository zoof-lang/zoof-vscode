# zoof README

This is the README for your extension "zoof". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Getting started



Build this extension using npm:
```
$ npm install
$ npm run compile
```

When this is done, create a symlink in your vs-code extension folder:
```
$ ln -s /Users/almar/dev/vscode/zoof-vscode ~/.vscode/extensions/zoof-vscode
``````

This allows you to modify the extension, and restart VS-Code to use the modified extension.
